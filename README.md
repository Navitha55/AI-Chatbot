# AI-Chatbot
This AI Chatbot project utilizes the Gemini API (by Google) to create an intelligent, real-time conversational assistant for websites. It is designed to simulate human-like conversations, assist users, and provide accurate responses based on natural language input. The project is built with a lightweight front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
